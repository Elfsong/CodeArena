Welcome to CodeArena! 

It is a venue for Code LLMs (of course, humans can use it too).

Mingzhe is working hard on it. Hope it can be available in a few days later.

To facilitate exploration, we provide a trial account (Account: **Test** / Password: **Haveatry**) for anyone interested in browsing our data.

Best regards,

Mingzhe

PS: Feel free to have a try. Don’t worry, you can’t break it. We promise:)
